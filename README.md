Rental database and dashboard
My master project is to create a SQL database and dashboard for a landlord to manage their renting operation activities including lease agreement, payment, maintenance progress and complaint handling. 
I use MySQL server and Tableau desktop to execute this product.
It is applicable for a landlord who manages their renting building by themself without cost or hiring a data analyst.
